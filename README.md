This project focuses on crime analysis using two datasets sourced from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of India. By leveraging data visualization and statistical methods, the project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to crime rates across different regions and timeframes. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and the public to better understand crime and formulate strategies for crime prevention and safety improvements.
